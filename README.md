# Week 4: Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Purpose of this project: Demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
Goal of this project: Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

**Tasklist**

- [ ] The submitted data set is tidy.

- [ ] The Github repo contains the required scripts.

- [ ] GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the *variables* and *summaries* calculated, along with *units*, and any other relevant information.

- [ ] The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

- [x] The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

## README
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

### CONTENTS OF REPO
1. Parent Repo which contains README.MD and RStudio_Project folder (W4_GCD_Project).
2. Within W4_GCD_Project folder is all the files needed to enable a reproducable analysis:

    2.1 Raw Data Folder: Original "un-tidied" / raw form of data
    
    2.2 Data Folder: Files created by RunAnlysis.R script file
    
    2.3 RStudio Project File: W4_GCD_Project.Rproj
    
    2.4 Codebook.md: Detailed markdown file of data profile and structure
    
    2.5 run_analysis.R: R Script to tidy Data and perform anlysis.
    

#### Project Briefing

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article (http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each *variable* for each *activity* and each *subject*.
